				<h2>Dealing with Conflict</h2>
					<p>I quit my finance job in New York city a few months ago and moved back to my parents home in Philadelphia.  I had no back-up plan and no idea what I wanted to do next.  At first, my mother was very suppportive.  She never liked the idea of me living in New York and preferred that I live closer to home.  However, after witnessing two months of me doing nothing, she pushed me to seek out work.  Before I came home, I was always a high achiever and hard-worker.  She recognized that I needed time to think about what kind of work I wanted to do next but realized quickly that I was too scared to make a choice about my career.  When she asked about my future plans, I did a few things: I isolated myself further by avoiding conversations with her and other friends/family members;  I put myself down repeatedly in private;  I lashed out at her for questioning me.</p>
					<p>Eventually, I realized that none of these responses were making me feel better and they certainly weren't accomplishing anything.  I was still unemployed, still scared to make any choices, ashamed of my childishness, and emotionally confused.  Inaction was not helping, so I'd have to try doing <em>something</em>.  I also knew that, despite this conflict, my mother and I are extremely close and her inquiries were out of love and concern rather than an attack on me.</p>  
					<p>If I could go back, I would try to better recognize inaction due to fear.  I can't hide from conflict, both internal and with others.  Recognizing it, facing it, and not being so hard on myself for having it, are probably the most important things I can do to confront conflict and the subsequent shame.</p>
