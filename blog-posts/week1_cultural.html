			<p>Based on Shereef's talk, I think that the DBC experience will be, in part, an excercise in normalizing vulnerability. It's challenging to say to other people, 'I don't get it' and it's hard not to internalize not understanding something. What I have noticed over the past week, however, is that I am relieved when I make the decision to ask for help. So, I'm just going to have to keep pushing myself to ask questions until it no longer feels uncomfortable (even if that never happens).
			</p>
			<p>It was comforting to hear Shereef's San Francisco to Seattle analogy when comparing students' varying levels of experience. The analogy made the DBC experience feel less 'out of my league' and is a good indication of just <em>how much more</em> everyone will be learning in the coming 18 weeks.
			</p>  
			<p>Super excited to learn as much as I can from everyone!</p>
