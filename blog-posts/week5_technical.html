				<p>Ruby is an object-oriented programming language which has <strong>Classes</strong> and <strong>Objects</strong>. Tutorialspoint defines classes as "the blueprint from which individual objects are created." Some of the objects which a class can have are <strong> instance variables</strong> and <strong>instance methods</strong>.  Instance variables are like the characteristics of the class and instance methods are functions of that class.</p>
				<p>You might be wondering why we have classes in the first place.  Classes are useful when you have a large amount of information that can be organized.  For example, what if you have a huge collection of Bollywood films and you'd like to compile their titles, dates of release, and starring actors?  You could create a variable for each title of each movie OR you could create an instance variable of '@title' for all Bollywood movie titles.  Classes allow you to apply characteristics and functions on a larger scale.</p>
				<p>Let's continue with the Bollywood example.  First, let's create a class called 'Bollywood'.<br><br>

				Then let's figure out what characteristics we want each Bollywood movie to have.  Let's use 'title', 'date', and 'actor' and set those as our parameters.  Because we have parameters which will eventually be used in a method within the class, we need to declare a method <em>'initialize'</em> when the class is created.<br><br>

				Next, we create the instance variables.  We use @ to represent an instance variable as opposed another kind of variable.<br><br>

				Now we can create a method in the class which utilizes the instance variables.<br><br>

				We're done!  We can now use .new to add as many Bollywood movies as we'd like.<br><br>
