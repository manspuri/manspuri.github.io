				<h2>Asking Questions Well</h2>
				<p>Below is a question which I posted on the DBC discussion board:</p> 
				<p><strong>I am having a bit of trouble with the 3. Web Basics challenge.  I added a index.html file to my local repository and committed - both worked.  However, when I typed in "git push origin master" to push my page to GitHub,  I received the following: "Username:", which requires input.  I tried to type in something but nothing happens when I type... Below is the message.<br><br>  
				Any thoughts as to what I might be doing wrong? Thanks!<br><br>
				sonias-imac:manspuri.github.io soniapuri60$ git push origin master<br>
				Username:<br>
				Password:<br>
				error: The requested URL returned error: 403 while accessing https://github.com/manspuri/manspuri.github.io.git/info/refs<br><br>
				fatal: HTTP request failedï»¿</strong></p>
				<p>Based on what I've researched on asking a question well, I think that the first thing I need to do is have some sort of descriptive title for my question.  For example, I could have written <strong>Terminal: Not allowed to type input for 'Username:' and 'Password:'</strong> as title to my post.  I think that I did a good job of providing context for my question.  I pasted in what I saw in my terminal and described what I had tried thus far.  Still, I think that my final question could have been more direct and specific.  Instead of saying <strong>'Any thoughts as to what I might be doing wrong?'</strong> I could have asked, <strong>'Why can't I type input into 'Username' and 'Password' when pushing changes onto github through the terminal?'</strong></p>
