				<h2>Margins, Borders, and Padding</h2>
				<p>In CSS, we can arrange our elements on the page using margins, borders, and padding. For example, if I had a webpage about gardening and I had some related but tangential links which I wanted to share, I would include them in a sidebar or an aside. A sidebar, as its name suggests, is usually positioned on the side of the webpage, as opposed to the center, because it is not the focus of my webpage. In order to position the sidebar to either side of my page, I could float the object and then adjust its margin, border, and padding. <br><br>
				<strong>Margins</strong>, <strong>padding</strong>, and <strong>borders</strong> are best explained through the box model.  All HTML elements can be thought of as boxes. So, what are margins, padding, and borders in the context of this box model?<br><br>
				<img src="http://css-tricks.com/wp-content/csstricks-uploads/thebox.png"/><br><br>
					<strong>Content:</strong> The content is where the text and/or images appear; or the vase which you want shipped to your friend.<br>
					<strong>Padding:</strong> Padding is the area directly around the content which separates the content from the border. It is literally the padding between the content and the walls of the box; like the bubble wrap surrounding the vase in a box.<br>
					<strong>Border:</strong> Borders surround the padding and the content of the box and inherit the color property of the box; or the actual, physical box which you are shipping.<br> 
					<strong>Margin:</strong> Margins clear an area around the border.  You cannot see the margins but they allow for room between one full element (content, padding, border, margin) and another full element on a page; the space between one shipping box and another in the truck which carries all of the boxes.<br><br>
					In CSS, margins and padding are declared in pixels. The measurements are declared starting at the top and working clockwise around the box.<br><br>
					.div {margin: 1px 2px 3px 4px}<br><br>
					The declaration above will create a box with a 1 pixel top margin, 2 pixel right margin, 3 pixel bottom margin, and 4 pixel left margin. If you declare only one pixel value, then it will apply to all sides of the box. 
				</p>
				<h3>Important:</h3>
				<p>When you are setting the width and height of an element, you are actually setting the height and width of the content area.  In order to calculate the full size of the element (how much space it takes up on the page in pixels), you must also account for the element's padding, margins, and borders.  Let's see an example below.
					</p>
				<p>We have an element which has a total width of 400px; the width of the content area is 350px.  What could the left + right margins, padding, and border values equal if the width of the content area is 350px?  The answer is:<br><br>
					width: 350px;<br>
					padding: 10px<br>
					border: 5px<br>
					margin: 10px;<br><br>
					You have 10px each for left padding and right padding, 5px each for left border and right border, and 10px each for left margin and right margin.  Another way to look at it is:<br><br>
					Total element width = content width + left padding + right padding + left border + right border + left margin + right margin.<br><br>
					The same example and formula can be applied to an element's total height.
