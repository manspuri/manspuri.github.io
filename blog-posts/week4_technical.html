				<h2>Ruby: Enumerable#cycle</h2>
				<p>First things first - an 'enumerable' is the term that we use to say we can get elements out of a collection, one at a time.  An 'enumerator' is the tool used to get each element out of its collection. Ruby has many enumerators and you can take a look at all of them at <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.2/Enumerator.html">Ruby-Doc.org</a>.</p>
				<p>This blog posts' focus will be on Enumerable#cycle. Enumerable#cycle can be used with arrays and hashes and it basically calls a block of code on each element repeatedly as many times as you ask it to, or forever if you don't give it a specific number of repetitions (an argument). A few important points about Enumerable#cycle:
					<ul>
						<li>The argument for #cycle specifies the number of times to cycle; it does not relate to the number of elements that the cycle runs through.</li>
						<li>If a non-positive number is given as the argument, #cycle does nothing.</li>
						</ul>
						</p>
				<p>It's also important to note that Enumerable#cycle will continue to call a block of code for each element for as many times as you ask it to.  If you don't provide a specific number as an argument, then you have an infitite loop on your hands.</p>

					<h3>Enough talking. Let's see an example.</h3>
				<p> Enumerable#cycle(argument) {|object| block of code }<br>
					a = [2, 3, 4]<br>
					b = {2: a, 3: b, 4: c}<br>
					a.cycle { |x| puts x } # ==> 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 4,... and so on...forever.<br>
					b.cycle(3) { |k, v| puts v } # ==> a, b, c, a, b, c, a, b, c
