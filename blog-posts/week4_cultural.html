				<h2>Diversity in All Forms</h2>
				<p>It's no secret that there is a huge gender disparity in the tech world.  When I first started thinking about web development as a potential career option, I came across the Dave-to-Girl ratio. In 1995 Carnegie Mellon tracked and compared the of men named Dave in Carnegie Mellon's computer science program to the total number of women in the program.  The ratio revealed that the number of men named Dave was larger than total number of women.  And while Carnegie Mellon's computer program boasts a higher percentage of women now than before, the number of females employed in technology is still lower than it should be.  Still, I think that gender disparity is one part of a larger issue: overall lack of diversity in tech.  When I say overall diversity, I mean diversity of age, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, and opinion (which can be influence by all of the other categories).</p>
				<h3>Potential Solutions</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Changing the way we think about learning: changing the way that everyone (including adults who are no longer in school) think about how they should learn, what they should learn, and what learning actually means.  For example, if we can convince a woman in a 3rd world country that she is absolutely capable of learning computer programming, and then teach her programming languages, she has more power than she did before.</li>
					<li>Making education more affordable: there are too many people who have very important opinions who do not have access to university education.  As a result, they don't have the opportunity to share and learn from others and current university students are deprived of valuable and <em>varying</em> opinions.  I believe that older, established universities will soon have to compete with smaller, less expensive schools such as DBC -- that competition will hopefully make the price of every istitution more affordable.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>I think that when we start to change the way learning and education is presented to people, we will start to change the kinds of people that we meet and have access to. I think that we need to find a way to reach out to more people of diverse backgrounds (those who could not afford school, those who thought they were too old to learn something new, those who don't believe that it's their place to learn more than they already know).</p>
				<h3>Other Ideas</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Computer Labs for women in 3rd world countries</li>
					<li>Lectures/courses on 'what learning means' and 'how to learn' - from grade school to the end of high school</li>
					<li>Less/NO emphasis on grades</li>
					<li>Encouraging hard work/effort over end-result or reaching a particular goal</li>
				</ul>
