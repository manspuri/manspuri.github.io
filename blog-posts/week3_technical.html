				<h2>JavaScript's Beauty</h2>
				<p>JavaScript is designed to work well across browsers and devices.  It's compatible with the latest devices.  Our tablets, notebooks, and smart phones all use some type of browser in order to view web applications. Therefore, it is beneficial to have a web application built using a programming language such as Javascript so that we can easily view/access a web application, in all of its beauty, across all devices.</p>
				<p>JavaScript is also designed to look into databases and present that data (e.g. pricing for various products, part numbers).  Companies, as opposed to individuals, which need to gather and understand their own data find this type of programming language very useful.
				<p>Node.js is a recently developed software platform which allows developers to create a high-performance web application using one language: JavaScript. This makes the work of a developer easier because they are only working with / editing one language.  It also reduces development time which benefits the end-client and/or user (you).</p>  
				<p>JavaScript makes static HTML5/CSS dyanmic.  HTML5 and CSS create the structure and style of a web page and JavaScript creates movement; that is, animations, 3-D graphics, and games within that web page.  Basically, JavaScript is written or embedded in teh HTML page, where it can interact with that page's Document Object Model, thereby allowing the page to perform in a more dynamic and interactive way.</p>
				<p>JavaScript is a fast programming language.
				</p>
				<p>For programmers, JavaScript has the added benefit of being accessible offline.  This is helpful in conducting work in remote locations.</p>
				<h2>JavaScript's Criticisms</h2>
				<p>JavaScript is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS).  This vulnerability allows attackers to manipulate websites and return un-intended and malicious script to visitors of the site.</p>
