				<h2>Stereotype Threat</h2>
				<p>According to a paper released by Steele and Aronson in 1995, stereotype threat is "being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group."</p> 
				<p>I was the only Indian student in a predominantly Jewish community for the majority of my primary and secondary education.  During my Junior year of high school, another Indian girl enrolled in our year.  To be honest, I did not think much of it.  I had not felt out of place before she arrived and I did not feel any change when she did arrive.  However, as the year progressed, I noticed that people began to compare us and it both confused and frustrated me.  Sure, we studied the same subjects but so did everyone else.  We both participated in music programs but so did other non-Indian students.  So, why was it, that when someone commented on one of us, they felt as if they needed bring the other up, as a means of comparison?  I'm not entirely sure where this story falls in the spectrum of stereotype threat.  I did not feel that my performance at school was affected by these comparisons so I wouldn't label it as an academic performance-related 'threat' but it did make me feel like an 'other' in a way that I had not previously felt.  It was as if I was put into a separate group or category with this other person based on our ethnicity (and maybe our gender) because there was suddenly an opportunity to do so - because now there were two instead of one that belonged to this ethnicity.</p>
				<p>More tangentially, I think that 'stereotype threat' can have varied effects on people.  Claude M. Steele's talk focused primarily on negative stereotypes that result in stereotype threats - those that threaten a person's performance by negatively influencing their perception of their ability to perform.  However I think that positive stereotypes can also negatively influence a person's perceptions about their capabilities.  When I say positive stereotypes, I mean those that are on the up-side of a stereotype as opposed to the down-side; e.g. if the stereotype is Asians are really good at math, then Asians, are on the up-side of the stereotype and non-Asians are on the down-side.  In this scenario, Asians should feel confident in their math abilities and non-Asians should feel less confident than they would if they weren't made aware of this belief.  But what about Asians who don't perform well in math despite this expectation?  By being part of a particular ethnic group, someone may try to exhibit the characteristics which they believe to be typical of that group whether or not those characteristics are in line with their own interests, beliefs, and/or personality.  If this person isn't able to maintain a standard which is expected of them as being of a group-type, they feel shame or failure.  Isn't this also a negative effect of stereotyping?  In one way, this example confirms that ethnicity does not have an impact on performance, which is significant.  But I think it's also important to question how much emphasis we should put on identifying specific characteristics with a group of people, whether those characteristics are positive or negative.</p>
				<p>I think open dialogue is probabably the most effective way to chip at the stereotype threat.  This will require one person to speak up if they feel the stereotype threat and another to be willing to listen and really consider the other's perspective.  The more it's talked about, the more people recognize it when it's happening.</p>
