				<h2>Learnin' About Thinking</h2>
				<p>I am almost equal parts Concrete Sequential, Abstract Sequential, and Abstract Random.  After reading characteristics from <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">this website</a>, I pulled the ones which I thought best represented my learning habits.</p>
				<ul><strong>Concrete Sequential</strong>
					<li>likes: order, logical sequence, following directions</li>
					<li>learns best when: they have a structured environment</li>
					<li>difficulties: questions with no right or wrong answers, working in groups</li>
				</ul>
				<ul><strong>Abstract Sequential</strong>
					<li>likes: analyzing situations before making a decision or acting</li>
					<li>learns best when: able to work alone, have access to experts or references</li>
					<li>difficulties: too little time to deal with a subject thoroughly</li>
				</ul>
				<ul><strong>Abstract Random</strong>
					<li>likes: focusing on the issues at hand, listening to others</li>
					<li>learns best when: able to maintain friendly relationships, in a personalized environment</li>
					<li>difficulties: competition, working with dictatorial/authoritarian personalities, accepting even positive criticism</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Thinkin' About Thinking</h2>
				<p>When learning new material, I tend to retreat and experiment on my own.  I thought that this was the best way for me learn because there are no distractions, I could concentrate on my own needs, allocate time for concepts which needed the most attention, etc.  However, after pairing a few times, I realize that I learn more efficiently when I work with others.  This is because I am not in a position to dwell on a problem and overthink solutions and whether I am on the right track.  As a pair, we usually just jump into the challenge and learn as we go.  Working with others pushes me out of inaction. Pairing also affords me the opportunity to see how others approach a challenge and then use similar techniques on subsequent challenges.</p>
				<p>Still, working in pairs and asking for input is not my natural tendency.  It's not my go-to strategy when I feel stuck on a challenge.  But maybe it should be.  Instead of spending hours on a challenge running my mind in circles thinking about finishing the challenge, doing it right, and putting enough into it, I should just get another perspective from a peer.  This may not always be the appropriate solution but it should be something that I do more of.</p>
