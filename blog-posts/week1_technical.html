					<h2>Apartment Therapy</h2>
						<a href="http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/"><img src="http://www.timothysue.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/apartment-therapy-2.jpg"/></a>
						<p>Apartment Therapy is a homebody's dream.  The website provides real people's home and apartment tours, design tips, decorating tips, renovations and DIY projects.  I spend hours on the site looking at the different ways in which people decorate their homes.  The most visually appealing thing about the site is its pictures.  They are prominently displayed in the center of the page and are also the largest objects on the page.  I don't think that the layout is very chic. In fact, I think that the right and left sides are a bit cluttered.  But I think that the website caters to people who are decorating their own far-from-perfect homes; people who are working with budget, environmental and space constraints.  I also love that you can easily run through photo tours of apartments and homes.

					<h2>Spotify</h2>
						<a href="http://www.spotify.com/"><img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/7/1391768502271/Spotify-008.jpg"/></a>
						<p>Spotify has been one of the best sources for discovering new music.  As someone who listens to a lot of music, Spotify helps me locate artists that I want to listen to and introduces me to artists that I would not have heard of otherwise.  In this way, Spotify not only benefits music-lovers but also musicians who are able to present their music to larger audiences.  I would describe the website as fluid.  You can move from artist to artist, album to album, song to song, with ease. I think that this format encourages people to explore music which they would not otherwise do.

					<h2>Need Supply Co. Blog</h2>
						<a href="http://blog.needsupply.com/"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pYjs3cDlU4I/T-NMBZMpdgI/AAAAAAAAAh0/WaiS6eck6JY/s400/need+supply+blog.png"/></a>
						<p>Like, Apartment Therapy, the Need Supply Co. Blog is a lifestyleish blog that covers art, design, food, drink, music, travel, etc.  I tend to frequent the travel, music, art, and design sections of the blog.  Unlike Apartment Therapy, the look of Need Supply's blog is uniform.  Photos are predominant in both, however Need Supply distributes them evenly across the page and includes a blurb under each photo.  It resembles a cooler looking newspaper website in some ways.  This website is also movement on the website, with the main photo at the top of the page changing every few seconds.
