					<h2>Apartment Therapy</h2>
						<a href="http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/"><img src="http://www.timothysue.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/apartment-therapy-2.jpg"/></a>
						<p>Apartment Therapy is a homebody's dream.  The website provides real people's home and apartment tours, design tips, decorating tips, renovations and DIY projects.  I am on this site for hours looking at people's homes.  The reason that I spend so much time on Apartment Therapy is because it is very easy to take virtual tours of these homes; you just click on one link and an floating slideshow opens up which you can easily exit out of if the pictures aren't interesting.</p>
						<p>The most visually appealing thing about the site is its pictures.  They are prominently displayed in the center of the page and are also the largest objects on the page.  I don't think that the layout is very chic. In fact, I think that the right and left sides are a bit cluttered.  But the website caters to people who are decorating their own far-from-perfect homes; people who are working with budget, environmental and space constraints.
						</p>
					<h2>Spotify</h2>
						<a href="http://www.spotify.com/"><img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/2/7/1391768502271/Spotify-008.jpg"/></a>
						<p>Spotify is one of my favorite sources for discovering new music.  As someone who listens to a lot of music, Spotify helps me locate artists that I want to listen to and introduces me to artists that I would not have heard of otherwise.  In this way, Spotify is not only benefits music-lovers but also musicians who are able to present their music to larger audiences.  I would describe the website as fluid.  You can move from artist to artist, album to album, song to song, with ease. I think that this format encourages people to explore music because returning to your original search, after some diversions, is not difficult.
						</p>
						<p>While the look of the website is , it's function is more appealing to me. Ultimately, I just want to listen to good music - and as much of it as possible. This means that the less time that I'm spending browsing, the better. For example, if I am able to access 'similar artists' quickly instead of spending five minutes searching for an artist that I think may be similar, then the website is effective. I think that Spotify does this.

					<h2>Need Supply Co. Blog</h2>
						<a href="http://blog.needsupply.com/"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-pYjs3cDlU4I/T-NMBZMpdgI/AAAAAAAAAh0/WaiS6eck6JY/s400/need+supply+blog.png"/></a>
						<p>Like, Apartment Therapy, the Need Supply Co. Blog is a lifestyleish blog that covers art, design, food, drink, music, travel, etc.  I tend to frequent the travel, music, art, and design sections of the blog.  Unlike Apartment Therapy, the look of Need Supply's blog is uniform.  Photos are predominant in both, however Need Supply distributes them evenly across the page and includes a blurb under each photo.  It resembles a cooler looking newspaper website in some ways.  There is also movement on the website, with the main photo at the top of the page dissolving into a new photo every few seconds.</p>
						<p>While I visit Need Supply's blog as frequently as Spotify and Hulu, my time on the site is brief.  Because of its news layout and because its content is less focused than the former two (Need Supply has many worlds to choose from in the header), I treat it like a news site; quickly checking in to see what's new. If a picture or a title interests me, then I will click on the link.
