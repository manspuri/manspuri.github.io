				<h2>Peer Pairing</h2>
				<p>Pairing has been a blessing over the past three weeks and I feel relieved and enlightened after I work through a challenge with someone.  As Phase 0 material becomes more challanging and builds upon itself, pairing with others helps me learn more than I would have on my own and ultimately allows me to complete each week's challenges.  And while I ultimately need to be able to understand concepts and come up with solutions on my own, pairing has been a great/efficient way to explore unfamiliar territory.</p>
				<p>Still, the act of pairing with someone makes me feel incredibly insecure about my abilities.  I have a tendency to compare myself to others and working with bootcampers who are picking up the material faster than I am makes me feel as if I am not learning the DBC material at the 'necessary' pace; that maybe I'm not going to be able to cut it.  Being asked to leave DBC is a pretty big fear of mine and pairing sometimes highlights this fear.</p>
				<p>I know myself well enough to know that this insecurity is probably not going anywhere; it will continue to creep up during pairing in Phase 0 and throughout my time pairing at DBC.  The only thing that I can think to do right now is recognize that the fear exists, realize that the benefits of pairing outweigh the discomfort that I feel, and work through the pairing session despite my insecurity.</p>
				<h2>Speaking Up</h2>
				<p>Reading the feedback was less painful than I thought it would be and receiving it was very helpful.  One of the most common pieces of feedback that I recieved was to be more vocal either when I had an opinion or when I was confused.  The first thing that I tell my pair when we start a session is that I go silent when I am trying to figure something out.  It would probably benefit me and my pair if I began to think out loud more.  Thinking out loud could just mean saying 'I don't know' 10 times, but at least my pair knows where I stand.  And, in the end, providing my pair with feedback during the session is also something which I hope to do more of.  Providing feedback on Socrates is good - because having something in writing is clear and can be referred to again and again if necessary.  However, I have found that providing constant feedback DURING my pairing session can also be valuable (and maybe more so).  For example, it is valuable for me to stop my pair after they've finished explaining something and either re-phrase what they said so that I know that I understand them OR ask them to explain again because I don't understand them.  This kind of constant feedback is honest and meant to help both individuals in the pair, which makes it kind.  Doing this can be difficult because I don't want to offend anyone, but the more I pair, the more I realize that everyone is an adult and is very willing to have open discussions.  Speaking up is an exercise in vulnerability which will, in the end, make the most of a pairing session.</p>
