				<h2>Exploring My Values</h2>
				<p>Honesty, Creativity, Affection, Music, Self-knowledge, Self-reliance, Self-respect, Will-power, Grit, Openness, Movement</p>
				<p>I don't know if I can say that one particular value is more important to me than another of the ones which I have listed.  However, 'honesty' is a value which I strive towards every day.  I think that honesty is incredibly powerful and liberating.  When I speak honestly, I feel both open, because I am not hiding anything but protected, because I have nothing to hide.  More directly, I think that being honest when providing advice ultimately benefits the person seeking advice.</p>	
				<p>I hope that I have can be honest with myself about my understanding of the material while at DBC.  I also hope that I have the strength to ask others for their honest feedback and opinions about my progress.  I hope that I can continue to recognize honesty as a value during the next 11 weeks, even if it is difficult to hear.</p>
