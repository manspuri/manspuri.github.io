				<h2>SQL Injection</h2>
				<p><strong>SQL Injection</strong> is a type of web attack targeted at data whereby a hacker injects SQL commands, allowing them to gain access to data that is held within a database and steal and/or modify data.  Databases are more susceptible to SQL injection when fields are available for user input to allow SQL statements to query the database directly.</p>
				<p>One way to combat SQL injection is through <strong>parameterized query</strong>.  A parameterized query separates executable code (SELECT name FROM) from the data.  It replaces the query string of the SQL query statement with '?'.  The '?' acts as a placeholder for the parameter.</p>
				<h2>NoSQL Versus SQL</h2>
				<p>SQL databases are <strong>relational databases (RDBMS)</strong>, meaning it recognizes relations between stored items of information.  NoSQL databases are non-relational databases.  While SQL databases are table-based, NoSQL databases are collections of key-value pairs, documents, and graph databases - those that do not have standard schema definitions which to adhere to.  SQL databases are more suited for complex queries, while NoSQL databases are more suited for hierarchical data storage and larger amounts of data.  Which type of database you use depends on the characteristics of your data.  If the data is complex and cannot be modeled using just tables, non-relational databases is probably more suitable.  Also, how often will the data be changing?  If the data is more fluid, then a non-relational database such as NoSQL would be a better choice.</p>
				<p>I haven't worked with non-relational databases yet (at least I don't think I have), so I don't know which I prefer.  I look forward to utilizing non-relational databases to organize and access more complex information.</p>
