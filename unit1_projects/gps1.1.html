      <h2>Pair Programming</h2>
  </header>
  <p>Pair programming is a technique where two programmers work alongside each other at one station. There is a driver who writes the code and there is a navigator who directs the driver and instructs them on what to write.  The driver and navigator relationship can take many forms.  Below are a few of the these forms.</p>
    <ol>
    <h2>Types of pair programming</h2>
        <li>Driver-Navigator Pairing</li>
        <p>In Driver-Navigator pairing the driver focuses on typing the code that is provided by the navigator. The navigator's role is talking and leading the driver.</p>
        <li>Ping-Pong Pairing</li>
        <p>In ping-pong pairing one person creates a test for code and the other person writes the code in an effort to pass the test.</p>
        <li>Expert-Novice Pairing</li>
        <p>This is a variation of driver-navigator pairing where one person is more knowledgeable than the other. The roles can vary. The expert or novice can act as the driver or the novice can observe while the expert drives and navigates.

    <p>Pair programming is beneficial to the learning process in DBC as it takes the strengths of one student and passes them on to others. </p>

        <h3>My Reflection on Pairing</h3>
        <p>This was actually my second pairing session. In addition to the practical benefits of pairing - learning from one another, utilizing each other's strengths, and catching typos - pairing also forced me out of my own head.  When I work alone, I never speak out loud.  But the act of verbalizing code to another person helped me to organize my thoughts and the code.  At times, the process was tedious.  Having to dictate each word and symbol takes more time than just typing it myself.  The process is even more tedious when the pair is working together remotely.  Still, I found the benefits to outweight the costs.</p>
        <p>On an emotional level, I have found both of my pairing sessions to be very encouraging.  When I work alone, I have a tendency to think that I am far behind my fellow DBC students, even if there is no indication of me being behind.  This may be because the work can be a little overwhelming and, more importantly, incredibly unfamiliar.  However in each pairing session, I am comforted by how each of us are encountering a learning curve.  Though the learning curve may look different for each person, we all can benefit from working with another.</p>
