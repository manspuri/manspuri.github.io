			<h2>Wireframed Websites</h2>
			<p>Below are wireframes for Apartment Therapy, Need Supply Co. Blog and Spotify. I used Balsamiq to create the mockups for my wireframes.</p>
			<h3>Apartment Therapy</h3>
			<img src="http://i.imgur.com/ywFeM4X.png?1" alt="Apartment Therapy Wireframe"/>
			<p><a href="http://apartmenttherapy.com">Apartment Therapy</a> provides ideas for home decoration and design by showcasing real people's homes via photo slideshows.  It also includes tips and instructions for DIY projects such as mini-renovations, painting, gardening, and organization.  Apartment Therapy provides practical and relevant home-care/decorating solutions. The website's visual challenge is to showcase a variety of posts on one screen so that the user is aware of the many 'tips and tools' that the website offers.</p> 
			<h3>Spotify</h3>
			<img src="http://i.imgur.com/65lmfen.png?1" alt="Spotify Wireframe"/>
			<p><a href="http://spotify.com">Spotify</a> is a music streaming service which allows subscribed users to listen to music on and offline.  It also recommends 'similar artists' to a user, thereby exposing the 'similar artist' to a larger listener population.  Spotify's visual challenge is to make it easy to locate the direct search bar so that they can find specific artists.  It should also be easy for the user to move back and forth from one artist to 'similar artists'.</p>
			<h3>Need Supply Co. Blog</h3>
			<img src="http://i.imgur.com/sl8Eb4j.png?1" alt="Need Supply Co. Blog Wireframe"/>
			<p>Need Supply Co.'s <a href="http://blog.needsupply.com">blog</a> offers mini-articles on current trends in art, design, food, drink, music, and travel among other things. If someone is interested in finding a seasonal recipe or recently showcased artists, this website is helpful. Need Supply Co.'s visual challenge, like Apartment Therapy, is to showcase a variety of posts so that the user is aware of the various topics the blog covers. Another visual challenge is to make it easy to locate posts within a specific topic (art/design or food/drink).</p>
