		<h1>Website Plan</h1>

		<p>My current website needs the following improvements:
			<ul>
				<li>Better color scheme</li>
				<p>Right now, the color scheme is bland; I plan on adding a high-resolution image as the entire background of the webpage.  The font will need to stand out with the image.  I will do this by experimenting with colors as well as font sizes.</p>
				<li>Visible Links</li>
				<p>The current links are very close to each other and the font is small.  This makes it difficult for users to differentiate between links or to even click on a link.  I want to make the links larger and stacked on top of each other rather an in a row.  I will also change the weight of the link's font when one hovers over the link.</p>
				<li>Obvious Separation Between Sections</li>
				<p>Currently, all sections are very close to one another.  I would like to separate the sections using floats, so that users are aware of the differences between each section (i.e. a divided space for blogposts and another for social media links).</p>
			</ul>
		<p>I am toying with the idea of having a link for a page which lists all blog-post entries.  This will eventually be necessary as the list of blog-post entries increase.  I also think that I should include a separate link for an 'About Me' section.</p>
